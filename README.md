<h1>Web Rest Scaper</h1>
This project is a web version of another application I made to scrape ArcGIS Rest services.
Utilizes GeoJSON requests to the web service using various scraping methods to obtain all features.
Allows the user to transform data fields and specify an output spatial reference.
The output is either a CSV or GeoJSON file.
